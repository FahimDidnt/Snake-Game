# Snake Game


## Description
The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. Players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body.
## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Food randomly generated on the screen
- Collision detection with boundaries and the snake's body
- Score tracking
- Smooth animation
- User-defined speed


## Requirements

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Turtle graphics library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
## Installation
- **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

- **Verify Turtle Module:** The Snake game script relies on the Turtle module, which is included in the standard library of Python. However, it's essential to ensure that the Turtle module is available on your system. You can test this by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

```shell
python -m turtle
```

- **Clone the Repository:** Clone the Snake game repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FahimDidnt/Snake-Game
```

- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the Snake game repository using the terminal or command prompt.
- Run the Snake game script by executing the following command
```shell
python snake.py
```

 *This will launch the game window, and you can start playing immediately.*
## Controls
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the movement of the snake.
- Try to eat the food (red squares) to grow longer.
- Avoid hitting the walls or yourself to survive as long as possible.
## Test Cases
- Test that the snake moves in the correct direction.
- Test that the snake grows when it eats the food.
- Test that the snake dies when it hits the walls.
- Test that the snake dies when it hits itself.
- Test that when the snake eats food, it counts scores.
## Test Results
- Snake moves in the correct direction: ***PASS***
- Counts scores when snake eats food: ***PASS***
- Snake grows when it eats the food: ***PASS***
- Snake dies when it hits the walls: ***PASS***
- Snake dies when it hits itself: ***PASS***
